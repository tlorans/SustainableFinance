# Integrated Assessment Models 

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are economic models, coupled with climate component, used to determine future outcomes from climate change. Based on these models, the SCC is computed in four steps:

1. Predict future emissions based on population, economic growth and other factors
2. Model future climate responses, such as temperature increase and sea level changes 
3. Assess the economic impact of these climatic changes on agriculture, health, energy use and other aspects of the economy
4. Convert future damages into their present-day values and sum to determine total damages 

These four steps provide a baseline value for the damages caused by emissions. The modelling process is then repeated after including a small amount of additional emissions to determine the impact on the total cost of emissions-related damages. 
The increase in damages from the additional emissions provides an estimated of the SCC.

To illustrate the process and the `Mimi Framework` we will use, let's illustrate the process with a simple illustrative one region model.
