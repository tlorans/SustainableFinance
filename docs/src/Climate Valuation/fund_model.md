# Climate-adjusted EBITDA

To conduct a full climate valuation assessment, we have to:

    1. Run a baseline model with an IAM applied to climate change
    2. Run a marginal model with an incremental unit of GHG emissions
    3. Determine the Social Cost of Carbon with the marginal damages
    4. Apply this SCC to the amount of emissions from the company 
    5. Compute the Climate-adjusted EBITDA

We will first implement and describe the IAM model we will use for this process, and implement it incrementally. 

This will allow us to learn how to use the `Mimi Framework` in a more extensive use.
